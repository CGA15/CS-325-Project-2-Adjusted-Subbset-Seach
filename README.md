# CS-325-Project-2-Adjusted-Subbset-Seach

Project Prompt:

The art exhibition organizers really liked your answers to the first group assignment. They
need your help again for their new project. This time they are holding an exhibition over a long
weekend, for three days. There are n groups of size g1, g2, . . . , gn registered to attend the event.
This time they are not allowing any group of more than l people, that is for all 1 ≤i ≤n, gi ≤ l.
However, they are allowing us to reorder the groups to fit them in a three day schedule. They need
to know the minimum number of people they need to admit per day in order to be able to admit
all groups in three days. Specifically, we need to answer the following question

•Design an algorithm to compute the minimum admittance per day to finish the exhibition in
three days. Any algorithm with polynomial time in n and l will receive the full credit for the
report part. For the implementation, we try to build test cases so that any algorithm with
O(l^2n^3) time (with a reasonable hidden constant factor) can pass them.
